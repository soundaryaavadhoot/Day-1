Learn about space and time complexity.

Time Complexity.
     Relation between input size and running time (Operations).
Best Case --> (1)
Average Case --> 0(n+1/2)
Worst Case -->0(n)
 
Compare:  0(n)   0(n^2)   0(n^3)
 n=1       1        1        1
 n=2       2        4        8
 n=3       3        9        27
 10⁵       10⁵      10¹⁰     10³⁰

Space Complexity.
     Space complexity depends upon inputsize.
Space--> Constant
